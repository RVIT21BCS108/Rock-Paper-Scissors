This Rock-Paper-Scissors game project is a simple console-based implementation of the classic hand game. The player is prompted to type 0 for rock, 1 for paper, or 2 for scissors. The computer randomly chooses its move, and the game compares the player's choice to the computer's choice to determine the outcome: win, lose, or draw. The game also handles invalid inputs by informing the player if their input is out of the expected range.
